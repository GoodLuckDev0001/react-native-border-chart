# What is react?
Is just a Javascript library that allow us to write mora Javascript to have interactivity on our websites.

# Elements of a react library
State: Is the data of our app.
Component: Is the independent and reusable code.
Props: Properties of the components.
JSX: HTML sintax inside Javascript.
VirtualDOM: Is a Javascript version of the DOM.

# The success of react, 4 principles
1. Dont touch the DOM, I'll do it.
2. Build the websites like lego blocks.
3. Unidirectional data flow.
4. UI, the rest is up to you.

# The job of a react developer
1. Decide on Components.
2. Decide the State and where it lives.
3. What changes when State changes.
